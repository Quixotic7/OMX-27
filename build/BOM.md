\* POTS - I used trimmer type pots because they're a little more low profile. But you can use alpha pots or whatever you have around.

\** OLED - 128x32 I2C display (SSD1306) with pin order ( GND, VCC, SCL, SDA )  
example from eBay:  
"0.91" 128x32 IIC I2C White OLED LCD Display DIY Module For Arduino"  
https://www.ebay.com/itm/293660021494  

\*** Headers:
1X04 (oled) 
1x14 x 2 (teensy) 
1x01 (teensy dac pin) 

TIP: Get 1x40 breakaway headers and cut what you need.  

[Mouser Cart (work in progress)](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=13c0107d30) - __DOES NOT include Teensy, OLED, LEDs or headers__

Mounting Hardware is NOT LISTED

Knobs are up to you.

### \* Key switches: 

Any of the Cherry MX RGB switches will work. Red/SilentRed/Blue/Brown/Black/SpeedSilver.  
Red is linear (45g). Blue is clicky & tactile (50g). Brown is tactile (45g). Black is similar to Red but 60g actuation force. SpeedSilver (shorter key travel for gamers) are linear and __Expensive__( 45g)

Cherry MX RGB part numbers:  

| name  | part num | type | actuation |
|-----|----|-----|----|
|SilentRed |[MX3A-L1NA](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/CHERRY/MX3A-L1NA/?qs=F5EMLAvA7IA6PAS7ry3I9w%3D%3D)| linear | (45g) |
|Red	|MX1A-L1NA| linear | (45g) |
|SilentBlack |[MX3A-11NA](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/CHERRY/MX3A-11NA/?qs=F5EMLAvA7ICizK1XKjfN9w%3D%3D)| linear | (60g) |
|Black	|MX1A-11NA| linear | (60g) |
|Brown	|[MX1A-G1NA](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/540-MX1A-G1NA/)| tactile | (45g) |
|Blue	|MX1A-E1NA| clicky & tactile | (50g) |

### Keycaps: 

Any MX-compatible keycaps will work, but you'll want one designed for backlighting, such as a "backlit two-shot", "translucent", "shine-through", or "windowed".  

I like the DSA profile caps for this application.

[DSA "Dolch" Keyset (Two Shot) "Windowed" Keys](https://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-dolch-keyset-two-shot/) (choose the __LED Kit__ option).  
These come in a pack of 4 keycaps. You will need 7 packs (@ ~$70 total).  

[Flashquark Translucent DSA Keycaps](https://flashquark.com/product/translucent-dsa-keycaps/) (in Black, White, Clear, Blue, Red) - __50 per pack__. ($12.99-$15.99 per pack)

[Blue Hat 1U DSA Blank Printed Keycaps PBT Keycaps](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SJKMNWC) (Gray Translucent) - __37 per pack__. ($15.55 per pack and prime shipping)  
(about the same as the black ones from Flashquark above)

[Maxkeyboard Black Translucent MX Blank](https://www.maxkeyboard.com/black-translucent-cherry-mx-blank-keycap-set-for-esc-w-a-s-d-or-e-s-d-f-and-arrow-keys.html) (pack of 9). ($21 for 3 packs)

### Knobs

So many opinions about knobs. 

Micro knobs (Befaco Style) can be found at these places:

### USB Cable: 

I recommend using a right angle extension cable [like this one from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015PSU5F6/)  

Be sure you have a good, known working, USB DATA CABLE and not just a charging cable.
