# TO-DO 

* Sequence direction - add pendulum and random

* Additional mode for MIDI settings (channel, etc)?

* Clock divide/mulitply?

* UI

* Copy note to other steps - or assign same note to all steps?

* Conditional triggers / step probability (see grid step on norns )

* what happens on CV when you have multiple keys pressed?

* Panic/all-notes-off on AUX?


# NEEDS MORE TESTING

 
* transpose entire sequence (needs testing)


# BUGS

* step record skipping steps - sometimes led stays on

* missing note off if octave is changed while holding note on - FIXED?

* CV sequence running all day and twice, the sequencer just paused for awhile and then started up again

* Can't change octave in OM mode


# IDEAS / FEATURE REQUESTS / WISH LIST

* chain patterns?

* extend pattern length - needs "pages" (1-8 bar drum patterns)

* knob banks (pots)?

* step probability

* Record CC automation (playback on clock ticks)

* supersteps ( lfo waveforms per step for CCs - with a bunch of preset waveforms?)

* randomize function (Random Patterns?)

* quantization for the live playing.

* Arps

* midi delay?

* controllable sequence drift?. P1: probability of step drift, P2: direction and distance, P3: velocity, P4: set of quantizations.

* CV mode - like a single channel version of a 0-control? maybe presets on the "white" keys and LFO's on the "black" 

* while ??


# DONE?

* add octave to note select
* note length?
